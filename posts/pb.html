                <hr />
                <h1>Computer Programming Overview</h1>
                <p>I assume today is your first day when you heard about computer programming. You are curious to know
                    what exactly is computer programming? Before you understand what is computer programming, you need
                    to understand what is computer program?</p>
                <p>I'm making an assumption that you know a little about what is computer and how to use it for Internet
                    browsing, Exploring Facebook or Checking e-mail using Gmail, etc.</p>
                <h2>What is Computer Program?</h2>
                <p><i>A computer program is a sequence of instructions written using a Computer Programming Language to
                        perform a specified task by the computer</i></p>
                <p>I assume, you did not understand what I have written about computer program but letï¿½s see two
                    important terms, which I have used in the above definition:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>Sequence of instructions</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Computer Programming Language</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To understand these terms, consider a situation when someone asks you about how to go to a nearby
                    KFC. What exactly do you do to tell him the way to go to KFC?</p>
                <p>You will use Human Language to tell the way to go to KFC something as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>First go straight, after half kilometer, take left from the red light and then drive around
                    one kilometer and you will find KFC at the right.</blockquote>
                <p>Here, you have used English Language to give several steps to be taken to reach to KFC. If they will
                    be followed in the following sequence, then you will reach KFC:</p>
                <pre class="result">
1.	Go straight
2.	Drive half kilometer
3.	Take left
4.	Drive around one kilometer
5.	Search for KFC at your right side
</pre>
                <p>Now, try to map the situation with computer program. Above sequence of instructions is actually a <b>
                        Human Program</b> written in <b>English Language</b>, which instructs on how to reach to KFC
                    from a given starting point. This same sequence could have been given in Spanish Language, Hindi
                    Language, Arabic or any other human language provided someone, who is asking about the way, knows
                    about such languages.</p>
                <p>Now, let's go back and try to understand about a computer program, which is a sequence of
                    instructions written in a Computer Language to perform a specified task by the computer. Following
                    is a simple program written in <b>Python</b> programming Language:</p>
                <pre class="result">
print "Hello, World!"
</pre>
                <p>Above computer program instructs computer to print "Hello, World!" on computer screen. </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>A computer program is also called a <b>computer software</b>, which can range from two lines
                            to millions of lines of instructions. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Computer program instructions are also called program source code and <b>computer
                                programming</b> is also called <b>program coding</b>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A computer machine without a computer program is just a dump box and thus computer program
                            brings a computer machine to live state.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Like human has several languages to communicate their message, computer scientists have developed
                    several computer-programming languages to provide instructions to the computer (i.e., to write
                    computer programs). We will see several computer programming languages in subsequent chapters.</p>
                <h2>What is Computer Programming?</h2>
                <p>If you understood what is <b>computer program</b>, then I will say <i>the act of writing computer
                        programs is called computer programming.</i></p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, there are 100s of programming languages, which can be used to write computer
                    programs and following are few of them:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>Java</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>C</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>C++</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Python</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>PHP</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Perl</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ruby</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What Computer Program can do?</h2>
                <p>Today computer programs are being used in almost every field, household, agriculture, medical,
                    entertainment, defense, communication, etc. Following are few applications of computer programs:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>MS Word, MS Excel, Adobe Photoshop, Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc., are example of computer
                            programs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Computer programs are being used to develop graphics and special effects in movie making.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Computer programs are being used to perform Ultrasounds, X-Rays, and other medical
                            examinations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Computer programs are being used in our mobile phones for SMS, Chat, and voice communication.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Who is Computer Programmer?</h2>
                <p>If you understood what is computer program and what is computer programming, then simply apply common
                    sense to understand who is computer programmer?</p>
                <blockquote>Someone, who can write computer programs or in other words, someone who can do computer
                    programming is called Computer Programmer</blockquote>
                <p>Based on computer programming language expertise, we can name computer programmers as follows:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>C Programmer</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>C++ Programmer</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Java Programmer</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Python Programmer</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>PHP Programmer</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Perl Programmer</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ruby Programmer</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What is Algorithm?</h2>
                <p>From programming point of view, an <b>algorithm</b> is a step-by-step procedure to resolve any
                    problem. An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite set of well-defined instructions.
                </p>
                <p>Thus, a computer programmer lists down all the steps required to resolve a problem before jumping to
                    write actual code. Following is a simple example of an algorithm to find out a largest number from a
                    given list of numbers:</p>
                <pre class="result">
1.      Get a list of numbers L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub>....L<sub>N</sub>
2.      Assume L<sub>1</sub> is the largest,  <b>Largest</b> = L<sub>1</sub>
3.	Take next number L<sub>i</sub> from the list and do the following
4.      If <b>Largest</b> is less than L<sub>i</sub>
5.         <b>Largest</b> = L<sub>i</sub>
6.      If L<sub>i</sub> is last number from  the list then
7.         Print value stored in <b>Largest</b> and come out
8.      Else repeat same process starting from step 3
</pre>
                <p>Above algorithm has been written in very crude way just because to make it clear to beginners,
                    otherwise if you will study computer algorithm subject then you will find standardized way of
                    writing computer algorithm.</p>

                <h1>Computer Programming Basics</h1>
                <p>I assume you are well aware of English Language, which is a well-known <b>Human Interface
                        Language</b>. English has a predefined grammar, which needs to be followed to write English
                    statements in a correct way. Likewise, most of the Human Interface Languages (Hindi, English,
                    Spanish, French, etc.) are made of several elements like verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
                    propositions, and conjunctions, etc.</p>
                <p>Similar to Human Interface Languages, Computer Programming Languages are also made of several
                    elements. I will take you through the basics of those elements and put some effort to make you
                    comfortable to use them in various programming languages. These basic elements are:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>Programming Environment</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Basic Syntax</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Data Types</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Variables</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Keywords</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Basic Operators</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Decision Making</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Loops</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Numbers</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Characters</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Arrays</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Strings</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Functions</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>File I/O</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I will explain all these elements in subsequent chapters with examples using different programming
                    languages. First we will try to understand meaning of all these terms in general and then we will
                    see how these terms can be used in different programming language.</p>
                <p>I believe if you understood above-mentioned elements related to any programming language, then you
                    are almost ready to write big enough programs in that programming language.</p>
                <p>I designed this tutorial to give you an idea about the following most popular programming languages:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>C Programming</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Java Programming</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Python Programming</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Major part of the tutorial has been explained by taking C as programming language and then I tried to
                    show how similar concepts work in Java and Python. So after completion of this tutorial, you will
                    find yourself familiar with these popular programming languages.</p>
                <h1>Computer Programming Environment</h1>
                <p>Though Environment Setup is not an element of any Programming Language, it is the first thing we need
                    to start programming with any Programming Language.</p>
                <p>When we are saying Environment Setup, it simply means we need to have a base on top of which we can
                    do our programming. Thus, we need to have required software setup, i.e., installation on our PC
                    which will be used to write our Computer Program, Compile and Execute it. For example, if you need
                    to browse Internet, then you need the following setup on your machine:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>A working Internet Connection to connect to the Internet.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Web Browser like Internet Explorer, Chrome, or Safari, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Similar way, you will need following setup to start with programming using any programming language.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>A text editor to create computer program.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A compiler to compile program into binary format.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>An interpreter to execute program directly.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are new to the computer, you yourself will not be able to set up either of these Softwares.
                    So, I suggest you take help from any technical person around you to set up programming environment
                    on your machine from where you can start. But for you, this is important to understand what are
                    these items.</p>

                <h2>What is Text Editor?</h2>
                <p>This is a Software, which will be used to write your computer program. Your Windows machine must have
                    a Notepad, which can be used to type your program. You can launch it by following these steps:</p>
                <pre class="result">
Start Icon &#8594; All Programs &#8594; Accessories &#8594; Notepad &#8594; Mouse Click on Notepad
</pre>
                <p>This will launch Notepad with the following window:</p>

                <p>You can use this software to type your computer program and save it in a file at any location. You
                    can download and install other good editors like <b>Notepad++</b>, which is freely available.</p>

                <p>If you are Mac user, then you will have <b>TextEdit</b> or you can install some other commercial
                    editor like <b> BBEdit</b>, etc., to start with.</p>
                <h2>What is Compiler?</h2>
                <p>You write your computer program using your favorite programming language and save it in a text file
                    called program file. What is next?</p>

                <p>Let's try to get a little more detail on how computer understands a program written by you using a
                    programming language. Actually, computer cannot understand your program directly given in the text
                    format, so we need to convert this program in a binary format, which can be understood by the
                    computer.</p>

                <p>The conversion from text program to binary file is done by another software called Compiler and this
                    process of conversion from text formatted program to binary format file is called program
                    compilation. Finally, you can execute binary file to perform the programmed task.</p>

                <blockquote>We are not going into detail of different constituents of a compiler and different phases of
                    compilation.</blockquote>
                <p>Following flow diagram gives an illustration of the process:</p>
                <img src="compiler.jpg" alt="Compiler" />
                <p>So, if you are going to write your program in any such language, which needs compilation like C, C++,
                    Java and Pascal, etc., then you will need to install their compilers before you start programming in
                    such languages.</p>
                <h2>What is Interpreter?</h2>
                <p>We just discussed about Compiler and Compilation Process. This is required in case you are going to
                    write your program in a programming language, which needs compilation into binary format before its
                    execution. Few examples of such programming languages are C, C++, Java.</p>

                <p>There are programming languages like Python, PHP and Perl, which do not need any compilation into
                    binary format, rather an interpreter can be used to read such program line by line and execute it
                    directly without any further conversion.</p>
                <img src="interpreter.jpg" alt="Interpreter" />
                <p>So, if you are going to write your program in any such language, which does not need compilation like
                    PHP, Python, Perl, and Ruby, etc., then you will need to install their interpreters before you start
                    programming in such languages.</p>
